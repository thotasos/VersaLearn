      content: `TypeScript has transformed how we build web applications. In this post, I'll share why I believe every web developer should learn TypeScript in 2026.\n\n## Type Safety Catches Bugs Early\n\nThe most obvious benefit of TypeScript is catching type errors at compile time rather than runtime. This means fewer bugs in production and a more confident development experience.\n\n## Better Developer Experience\n\nWith TypeScript, your editor becomes significantly more powerful. Autocomplete, inline documentation, and refactoring tools all work better when types are available.\n\n## Scalable Codebases\n\nAs your project grows, TypeScript helps maintain code quality. Interfaces serve as contracts between modules, making it easier for teams to collaborate without breaking each other's code.\n\n## The Ecosystem Has Caught Up\n\nAlmost every major library now ships with TypeScript definitions. The days of fighting with \`@types\` packages are largely behind us.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nIf you're new to TypeScript, start by adding it to an existing JavaScript project. Rename your files from \`.js\` to \`.ts\` and fix the errors one at a time. You'll be surprised how quickly you become productive.`,

      content: `Machine learning doesn't have to be intimidating. In this guide, I'll walk you through the essential concepts and show you how to build your first ML model.\n\n## What is Machine Learning?\n\nAt its core, machine learning is about teaching computers to learn patterns from data. Instead of writing explicit rules, we let algorithms discover patterns automatically.\n\n## Types of Machine Learning\n\n### Supervised Learning\nYou provide labeled data — inputs paired with correct outputs. The algorithm learns to predict outputs for new inputs.\n\n### Unsupervised Learning\nYou provide unlabeled data and let the algorithm find structure on its own, like clustering similar items together.\n\n### Reinforcement Learning\nAn agent learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.\n\n## Your First Model\n\nLet's build a simple classification model using scikit-learn:\n\n\`\`\`python\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_iris\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n\n# Load data\niris = load_iris()\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(\n    iris.data, iris.target, test_size=0.2\n)\n\n# Train model\nmodel = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Evaluate\naccuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)\nprint(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2%}")\n\`\`\`\n\nThis simple example demonstrates the core ML workflow: load data, split into train/test, train a model, and evaluate its performance.`,

      content: `After building design systems for three companies, here are the key lessons I've learned about creating sustainable, scalable component libraries.\n\n## Start with Design Tokens\n\nDesign tokens are the foundation of any good design system. They're the smallest units of design — colors, spacing, typography, shadows — expressed as variables.\n\n## Component API Design Matters\n\nThe API of your components determines how developers use your system. A well-designed API is intuitive, consistent, and hard to misuse.\n\n## Documentation is Not Optional\n\nIf your design system isn't well-documented, it won't be adopted. Every component needs examples, props documentation, and usage guidelines.\n\n## Build What You Need\n\nDon't try to build every component upfront. Start with the most commonly used components and add new ones as needed. A small, well-maintained system beats a large, neglected one.\n\n## Accessibility from Day One\n\nAccessibility should be baked into your components from the start. It's much harder to retrofit than to build in from the beginning.`,
